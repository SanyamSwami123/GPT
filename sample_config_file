Key Sections Explained
Model:

type: The type of model architecture (e.g., transformer, LSTM).
name: Predefined model variant or specific configuration (e.g., BERT, GPT-3).
hidden_size: Dimensionality of the hidden layers.
num_hidden_layers: Number of layers in the model.
num_attention_heads: Number of attention heads in multi-head attention.
intermediate_size: Size of intermediate layers.
vocab_size: Size of the vocabulary.
